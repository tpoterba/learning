# learning

- [docstring formatter](docstring_formatter/formatter.html): Learn some JS and HTML! Implemented a webpage that can reformat docstring paragraphs (or fixed-width paragraphs in general) so it's easier to edit them without having redo all line breaks manually.
- [PR scorecard](pr-scorecard/pr-scorecard.html): Keep track of GitHub duties and randomly select a reviewer (mostly written by Cotton).
- [gitstack](gitstack/gitstack.py): Not a learning project, but a productivity hack for when I forget my branch names.
